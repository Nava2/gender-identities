#JSON Gender Identities

Facebook <a href = "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/02/heres-a-list-of-58-gender-options-for-facebook-users/">recently did something cool</a> and expanded the ways a user could identify their gender on the site.

The whole internet should be doing this, and I'm not totally sure about the most proper way of rolling out such functionality, but for now here are some JSON objects that contain gender identies (`identities.json`) and pronound (`pronouns.json`). I will be adding example HTML&JS for examples on how to roll out this functionality on your website/sign up form/etc.

I'm not very familiar with programming and manipulating data on the web, so if I'm doing something wrong please tell me :)

##Can I Contribute?
**Please!!!**<br>
If I'm missing an identitiy, pronoun, or when the example code comes around please feel encouraged modify or improve any of the code in this repositoy!

##Usage
#Use it however and wherever you want!
